1-1-1-global-methodology: This indicator provides the proportion of the total population and the proportion of the employed population living in households with per-capita consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of US$1.25. It is calculated by dividing the number of persons living in households below the poverty line (disaggregated by sex, age and employment status) by the total number of persons (disaggregated by the same sex, age and employment status groups).

3-1-2-global-methodology: 'Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of deliveries attended by health personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for newborns. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included. Computation Method: The number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth attended by a skilled health personnel (doctors, nurses or midwives) during delivery is expressed as a percentage of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in the same period.'

3-3-1-global-methodology: 'Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations as defined as the number of new HIV infections per 1000 person-years among the uninfected population. The incidence rate is the number of new cases per population at risk in a given time period. Longitudinal data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available for large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. HIV incidence is thus modelled using the Spectrum software. HIV incidence can also be modelled using the Spectrum software.'
