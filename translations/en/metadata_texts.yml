The incidence rate is the number of new cases per population at risk in a given time period. Longitudinal data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available for large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. HIV incidence is thus modelled using the Spectrum software.

3-3-3-global-methodology: 'Incidence of malaria is defined as the number of new cases of malaria per 1,000 people at risk each year. Computation Method: Malaria incidence (1) is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 population per year with the population of a country derived from projections made by the UN Population Division and the proportion at risk estimated by a country's National Malaria Control Programme. More specifically, the country estimates what is the proportion at high risk (H) and what is the proportion at low risk (L) and the population at risk is estimated as UN Population * H + UN population * L/2. The number of new cases, M, is estimated from the number of malaria cases reported by a Ministry of Health which is adjusted to take into account (i) incompleteness in reporting systems (ii) patients seeking treatment in the private sector, self-medicating or not seeking treatment at all, and (iii) potential overdiagnosis through the lack of laboratory confirmation of cases. The procedure, which is described in the World malaria report 2008 (2), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported cases, reporting completeness and likelihood that cases are parasite positive) with data obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health-service use.'

3-c-1-global-methodology: 'Though, traditionally, this indicator has been estimated using 2 measurements: density of physicians, and density of nursing and midwifery personnel. In the context of the SDG agenda, the dataset is expanded to physicians, nursing personnel, midwifery personnel, dentistry personnel and pharmaceutical personnel. The dataset is planned to progressively move to cover all health cadres. The method of estimation for number of physicians (including generalist and specialist medical practitioners) depending on the nature of the original data source may include practising physicians only or all registered physicians. The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to draw. The figures for number of dentistry personnel include dentists, dental technicians/assistants and related occupations. Due to variability of data sources, the professional-level and associate-level occupations may not always be distinguishable. The figures for number of pharmaceutical personnel include pharmacists, pharmaceutical technicians/assistants and related occupations. Due to variability of data sources, the professionallevel and associate-level occupations may not always be distinguishable. In general, the denominator data for workforce density (i.e. national population estimates) are obtained from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects database. In cases where the official health workforce report provides density indicators instead of counts, estimates of the stock were then calculated using the population estimated from the United Nations Population Division's World population prospects database (2015).'

7-2-1-global-methodology: 'The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources. It is calculated by dividing consumption of energy from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption includes consumption from: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste. Total final consumption of energy is calculated from national balances and statistics as total final consumption minus non-energy use. Renewable energy consumption is derived from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total final consumption, electricity output and heat output. All volumes reported in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively.'

Real GDP per capita is calculated by dividing GDP at constant prices by the population of a country or area. The data for real GDP are measured in constant US dollars to facilitate the calculation of country growth rates and aggregation of the country data. Computation Method: The annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is calculated as follows: a. Convert annual real GDP in domestic currency at 2005 prices for a country or area to US dollars at 2005 prices using the 2005 exchange rates. b. Divide the result by the population of the country or area to obtain annual real GDP per capita in constant US dollars at 2005 prices. c. Calculate the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in year t+ 1 using the following formula: [(G(t+1) – G(t))/G(t)] x 100%, where G(t+1) is real GDP per capita in 2005 US dollars in year t+1 and G(t) is real GDP per capita in 2005 US dollars in year t.'

It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials measured in metric tonnes. DMC measures the amount of materials that are used in economic processes. It does not include materials that are mobilized the process of domestic extraction but do not enter the economic process. DMC is based on official economic statistics and it requires some modelling to adapt the source data to the methodological requirements of the MFA. The accounting standard and accounting methods are set out in the EUROSTAT guidebooks for MFA accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA accounting is also part of the central framework of the System of integrated Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA).'
