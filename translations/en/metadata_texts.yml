Computation Method: Malaria incidence (1) is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 population per year with the population of a country derived from projections made by the UN Population Division and the proportion at risk estimated by a country's National Malaria Control Programme. More specifically, the country estimates what is the proportion at high risk (H) and what is the proportion at low risk (L) and the population at risk is estimated as UN Population * H + UN population * L/2. The number of new cases, M, is estimated from the number of malaria cases reported by a Ministry of Health which is adjusted to take into account (i) incompleteness in reporting systems (ii) patients seeking treatment in the private sector, self-medicating or not seeking treatment at all, and (iii) potential overdiagnosis through the lack of laboratory confirmation of cases. The procedure, which is described in the World malaria report 2008 (2), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported cases, reporting completeness and likelihood that cases are parasite positive) with data obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health-service use."

In the context of the SDG agenda, the dataset is expanded to physicians, nursing personnel, midwifery personnel, dentistry personnel and pharmaceutical personnel. The dataset is planned to progressively move to cover all health cadres. The method of estimation for number of physicians (including generalist and specialist medical practitioners) depending on the nature of the original data source may include practising physicians only or all registered physicians. The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to draw. The figures for number of dentistry personnel include dentists, dental technicians/assistants and related occupations. Due to variability of data sources, the professional-level and associate-level occupations may not always be distinguishable. The figures for number of pharmaceutical personnel include pharmacists, pharmaceutical technicians/assistants and related occupations. Due to variability of data sources, the professionallevel and associate-level occupations may not always be distinguishable. In general, the denominator data for workforce density (i.e. national population estimates) are obtained from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects database. In cases where the official health workforce report provides density indicators instead of counts, estimates of the stock were then calculated using the population estimated from the United Nations Population Division's World population prospects database (2015)."

It is calculated by dividing consumption of energy from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption includes consumption from: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste. Total final consumption of energy is calculated from national balances and statistics as total final consumption minus non-energy use. Renewable energy consumption is derived from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total final consumption, electricity output and heat output. All volumes reported in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively."

Concepts: The OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers. Although an OECD manual, the application is global. During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in October 2015. The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge - including knowledge of humankind, culture and society - and to devise new applications of available knowledge. Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques instrumentation, software or operational methods.The Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. Computation Method: Computation of the indicator Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants uses  available population data as denominator."

The goal of this indicator aims to generate the proportion of municipal solid waste regularly collected and that is adequately treated and disposed out of all the total municipal waste generated by the city. Concepts: It will be necessary to define the following components to compute the proportion of municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate treatment and disposal out of all the total municipal solid waste generated by the city: Municipal Solid Waste, Regularly Collected Municipal Solid Waste, Uncollected Municipal Solid Waste, Total Municipal Solid Waste Generated by the City, Municipal Solid Waste with Adequate Final Treatment and Disposal. Computation Method: The numerator of this indicator is 'municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate final treatment and disposal' and the denominator is 'total municipal solid waste generated by the city' multiplied by 100. Multiplication of the municipal solid waste generation per capita and population of the city can estimate total municipal solid waste generated by the city. When the municipal solid waste generation per capita is not available, household survey for a daily waste generation in household and other premises (e.g. restaurants, hotels, hospitals, schools, etc.) should be conducted. Since the waste generation can differ according to the seasons, the survey should be conducted at least two times a year to estimate the municipal solid waste generation per capita. Municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate final treatment and disposal is estimated through qualitative judgement of the degree of environmental control of facilities where the city's municipal waste is collected and transported. The judgement of environmental control can be conducted in line with the criteria below. Another important thing is to deduct residue amount from treatment facilities to avoid double count."

11-6-2-global-methodology: "Definition: The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameters (PM2.5) is a common measure of air pollution. The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter. Computation Method: The annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016a; Shaddick et al, 2016)."

10-6-1-global-methodology: "Definition: The indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these two components are identical. The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board. Computation Method: The computation uses each institutions' own published membership and voting rights data from their respective annual reports. The proportion of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights allocated to developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The proportion of membership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members, divided by the total number of members."
